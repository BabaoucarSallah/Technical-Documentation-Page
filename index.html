        <h1>How to Create Technical Documentation with Examples</h1>
        <p>
          All software products with simple or complex needs should be
          accompanied by technical documentation to help stakeholders and
          developers understand the software development. It does not end there
          – it also requires product documentation and user manuals for the
          benefit of customer onboarding and using the product.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without technical documentation, developers and customers are in the
          dark about the purpose of your software. It becomes hard to
          troubleshoot issues and ensure the software is working properly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Technical documentation is a vital aspect of working software, and
          should not be skipped during the release cycle. Whether it’s release
          notes, knowledge bases, or user manuals, remember that 51% of
          customers want to see a FAQs section on a website when making an
          online purchase.
        </p>

        <p>
          <cite>"Docs or it didn’t happen"</cite> is a mantra for anyone
          building a software product, and means that documentation is more than
          a byproduct or afterthought of your project. It closes the gap between
          development and software users, as well as the gaps between those who
          are involved in building the software.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="section2">
        <h2>What is technical documentation?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Technical documentation describes and explains anything to do with
            your software product, ranging from internal documentation for teams
            to external documentation written for end users.</strong
          >
          It encompasses all written documents relating to software product
          development and many different types are created throughout the
          software development lifecycle (SDLC).
        </p>

        <p>
          It describes the features and functionality of the product clearly so
          that anyone can use it. The primary goal is to explain a particular
          aspect of the product to the target audience. Although it comes in a
          number of different forms, most technical documentation is published
          online and it’s normally written by technical writers, developers, and
          project managers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Technical documentation should be clear, concise, and accurate, and
          actually, solve a problem for your users.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="section3">
        <h2>Importance of technical documentation</h2>
        <p>
          Technical documentation is vitally important for your software
          company. Here are some reasons why.
        </p>

        <ol type="i">

            <h3 id="section3-subsection0">
              Enables quick decision-making by the product team
            </h3>
            <p>
              When your product team has access to the right technical
              documentation, they can make much quicker decisions. They don’t
              have to scroll back through emails or threads in collaboration
              tools – they can instead instantly consult the documents produced
              alongside the software that explains how everything works and
              records the reasoning behind the decisions.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 id="section3-subsection1">Contextual help for users</h3>
            <p>
              When customers are using their software they can access your
              technical documentation alongside the product for help in using
              the tool. Documentation can be displayed in-app so customers don’t
              have to switch contexts when they run into issues. This improves
              the overall usability and experience of your software product.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 id="section3-subsection2">Marketing tool</h3>
            <p>
              Having robust technical documentation makes advertising your
              product to potential customers easier. Many customers will be
              researching in more detail how your product works and technical
              documentation can explain your software features in more depth
              than you can get with typical marketing materials.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 id="section3-subsection3">Reduces tech support calls</h3>
            <p>
              When you have comprehensive technical documentation, customers can
              consult the docs when they run into technical issues. This reduces
              the number of inbound calls you get to your tech support line and
              means you can support more customers on a smaller budget. Most
              customers prefer troubleshooting problems themselves instead of
              waiting for someone to help them.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 id="section3-subsection4">Records developer ideas</h3>
            <p>
              Your <mark>software documentation</mark> can record ideas that
              your developers have with your software product. Even if you don’t
              implement them right away, further down the line you’ll be able to
              look back for features that you might want to consider or other
              changes you want to make. Developers don’t necessarily remember
              their ideas later on so your documentation is a good place to keep
              a record.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Your technical documentation is a roadmap for projects you want to
              develop in the future, noting the plans you have for the
              development of your product and new features that you have in the
              pipeline. It makes sure everyone in your team is on the same page

            <p>
              Documentation is an important form of communication – your
              stakeholders and developers don’t need to talk to each other
              directly to access information about the software. Your
              documentation saves knowledge for posterity and enables your team
              to look back at work that has previously been completed in order
              to inform their future decisions.

          Here are the steps you need to go through in order to create technical

              Decide on type of audience and type of documentation
            </h3>
            <p>
              First and foremost, you need to be aware of your target audience
              for your documentation. Is it your customers, other developers,
              the product team, or any other stakeholder? By knowing who your
              audience is, you’ll be able to adapt the tone and style of your
              documentation to make it more relevant and engaging. If you don’t
              know who your audience is, your documentation will be unfocused
              and unhelpful. Defining your audience at the beginning stage of
              your documentation process will aid in document creation and
              ensure you have a clearly defined target.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 id="section4-subsection1">Research on topics</h3>
            <p>
              Once you’ve defined your audience, you need to research the topics
              that you’re going to cover in your documentation. You can’t hope
              to write effective technical content if you don’t have a clear
              idea of the topics you’re going to write about. At this stage,
              it’s a good idea to work with your team to brainstorm different
              topics and assign various research tasks to different team
              members.
            </p>

            <p>It’s important to ask yourself questions like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                What areas do we want our technical documentation to include?
              </li>

              <li>
                What is the goal that we want to achieve with our technical
                documentation?
              </li>

              <li>
                Do we have any existing documentation that we can already work
                with?
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Make sure it’s a team effort to research the topics – you don’t
              have to go it alone.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 id="section4-subsection2">Capture knowledge</h3>
            <p>
              When writing your documentation, it’s likely that you won’t be the
              only author. You’ll need to collaborate with other stakeholders in
              your team in order to produce technical documentation. At this
              stage, you need to work with Subject Matter Experts to capture
              knowledge that you’re going to use to write your articles.
            </p>

            <p>
              Take your time to work out who is the most appropriate person to
              author different topics of your technical documentation, and reach
              out to them to assign them the task. You can also conduct
              interviews with your SMEs and write the content yourself.
            </p>

            <p>
              Keep detailed records of your topics and the person responsible
              for providing the content, and keep track of what stage your
              content is at.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 id="section4-subsection3">
              Design templates and organize content
            </h3>
            <p>
              While the most important part of your documentation is the actual
              written content, it’s also a good idea to consider how your docs
              will look visually for the end user. You’re aiming for a
              well-organized and visually appealing documentation site rather
              than a jumble of badly designed notes that are no help to anyone.
            </p>

            <p>
              When thinking about documentation design, consider the structure
              and navigation of your content. Your users are typically turning
              to technical documentation in order to find specific information
              or a solution to a problem, so your research should allow them to
              accomplish this task quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
              Remember to place your information into categories and
              subcategories that users can search through efficiently. Ideally,
              you should have a search bar that users can use to instantly jump
              to the information that they’re looking for.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 id="section4-subsection4">Get started with content creation</h3>
            <p>
              You should already have kick-started the writing process with
              documentation research and collaboration with SMEs. Writing
              technical documentation is a team effort and you will have many
              contributors taking part in this collaborative process.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you haven’t already, meet with the team and delegate content
              tasks to the most appropriate member based on their skills. The
              best documentation is produced when writers start with outlines,
              and target their documentation towards a particular user.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your documentation should start with a high-level outline for each
              of the topics you’re planning to cover. Gather the rest of the
              content you need for your piece of content along with any
              supporting visuals.
            </p>

            <p>
              Remember to write in plain and clear language that is easily
              understandable for the user. Don’t assume that readers have the
              same level of prior knowledge as you – include as much context as
              possible to help with comprehension. Write as much content as
              needed to convey your point and not a word more – less is most
              definitely better when it comes to documentation.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 id="section4-subsection5">
              Review and collaborate with your team
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once you have got started on your content, you’ll need to bring in
              SMEs to review your content for accuracy. Bring them in just after
              the first draft and after the final draft to give their feedback
              on your documentation. After the first draft, you want to get
              feedback on the broad outline and flow of the document, rather
              than feedback on typos and grammar. Only after the final review do
              you want in-depth criticisms of the way you have written your
              content.
            </p>

            <p>
              Seek peer reviews with other members of your team who can test
              your technical documentation for usability. Ask someone else to go
              over your documentation and record any areas where they got lost
              or confused. Once you have your peer-review feedback, incorporate
              the changes into your documentation.
            </p>

            <h36 id="section4-subsection6">Publish the content</h36>
            <p>
              When you’ve reviewed your content several times, it’s time to
              publish your documentation ready for your audience. When your
              documentation is live, go over it to check for any last-minute
              updates and make sure that it’s free of error.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you publish your content, you may want to use knowledge-base
              software like Document360 which is a good way to host your
              documentation. It comes with in-built information architecture and
              category organization, along with a prominent search bar and
              mobile responsiveness.
            </p>

            <p>
              After your site is live, you may want to run further tests on the
              effectiveness of the documentation by gathering feedback from your
              users. Audit the navigation of your documentation to check that
              users can easily get around and find what they’re looking for –
              identify things like broken links and that navigational elements
              are working properly.

            <p>
              Your technical documentation is never done. If you’re using the
              appropriate software, you’ll have analytics you can review that
              shows you the effectiveness of your content. You should always be
              reviewing your documentation for updates and avoid letting it grow
              stale.
            </p>

            <p>
              You need to keep your documentation in line with new product
              releases and updates. Schedule in regular maintenance for your
              content based on insights that you gather from your analytics,
              such as failed searches or negative article ratings.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you use the right software you can save previous versions of
              your documentation in case you need to revert back to it later.

        <h3 id="section5-subsection0">Do:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep it simple and clear – don’t overcomplicate your documentation
            or use complex language.
          </li>
          <li>
            Always have your user in mind – whenever you write documentation,
            make sure you’re clear on who it’s for.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make it visual – if you can represent what you’re trying to convey
            with an image, then do that.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go through a thorough review process – if you can, make sure you
            have several people review your work during the writing phase.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="section5-subsection1">Don’t:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assume that your audience is familiar with your topic – always
            provide as much context as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use passive voice – always use active voice instead: “He pressed the
            button” rather than “the button was pressed by him”.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use acronyms – if you must use acronyms then clearly state the
            meaning of the acronym next to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to be funny – what might be amusing to you could be insulting or
            offensive to your readers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Don’t make the mistake of underestimating how important technical
          documentation is to your company’s overall success. It is an essential
          part of communication and means that members of your team don’t
          literally have to be available every time someone has a question,
          whether that be a customer or a stakeholder from your team.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don’t have to approach technical documentation with a heavy heart
          – if you follow the steps we’ve outlined in this guide then you’ll be
          well on your way to creating content that is helpful for your users.
          They’ll be empowered to use your product and have more fun using it,
          which is exactly the goal of technical documentation.
